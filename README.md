•	Houses Page: where the user can see general information about each house as founder shield region 
•	Search page: allow the user to look for specific character and pendent to develop search by houses.

## Objectives:
•	Practice different techniques learned in the SDE course 
•	Use different programing Java Script language structures as arrays. Objects and classes.
•	Practice react development as a front-end tool.
•	Use CSS and bootstrap to design the Web App page and component.
•	Use GitHub as control development tool


## Technical references 
The application was developed in React- java script and some tools were used as npm, Axios bootstrap, CSS and git hub.
React Router was used to provide one-page App also a main bar menu to give a fluid access to the user at all functionally available pages.
The App files has the basic structure from react projects. The files were store under SCR folder in folders according with the file type and components (components, pages, CSS, imagens, services and routes)
Some of the images were taken from https://thronesapi.com/ and adapted to run locally.


## APIs
Calls a API https://anapioficeandfire.com/Documentation require to get the principal information, also the API https://thronesapi.com/ was used to bring some characters pictures.
Objects were used to save the information obtained from the APIs. 
Record your notes/research here:
The app has ne posted in git hub xxx 
Status APP and Plans
The character and houses pages were developed according with the initial requirements and The quiz page is still in development.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
